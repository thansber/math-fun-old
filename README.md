math-fun
========

My 2nd grade daughter needed some extra practice with some math problems, and I have been playing 
with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) recently, so I decided to create a small web app 
to create random math problems for her.

Feel free to [use it your self](http://toddhansberger.com/math-fun/index.html).
